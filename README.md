# Java-Right_Angled_Triangle
This Java program generates a right-angled triangle pattern of numbers in an incremental sequence. It prompts the user to input a size (n) and prints n rows, where each row contains an increasing count of numbers starting from 1. The outer loop controls the rows, while the inner loop prints numbers sequentially, ensuring proper alignment.
